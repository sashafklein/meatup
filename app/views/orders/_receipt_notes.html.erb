	This order represents a hold of estimate size (<%= @total_weight %> lbs), placed on <%= @a.name %>, a <%= @a.weight %> lb <%= @a.breed %> <%= @a.animal_type %>, raised sustainably on <%= @a.ranch.name %>, in <%= @a.ranch.city %>, <%= @a.ranch.state %>.  MeatUp and <%= @a.ranch.name %> reserve the right to automatically adjust the final poundage of your order to match actual weight and availability, within a variance of EXPECTED VARIANCE.  As part of this order, you agree to be charged or refunded the difference between this estimate and the final poundage at the price-per-pound of this order.  Once confirmed and delivered, the meat will be available at <%= link_to "your host", host_path(@h) %>'s for pickup over a period of no more than 24 hours.  As a customer, you are responsible for organizing a timely pick-up of your order, and if you are not personally able to retrieve your order during the pickup window, please contact your host, <%= @h.user.name %>, to make special arrangements.  Neither MeatUp, nor <%= @a.ranch.name %>, nor <%= @h.user.name %> is responsible for any damage that may occur to the contents of your order if it is retrieved outside of the established pickup window.
