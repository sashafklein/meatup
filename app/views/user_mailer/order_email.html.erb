        <h1>Well thanks, <%= @user.name.capitalize %>!</h1>
        <p>
          Your <%= number_to_currency(@order.total) %> order was a success. Your card has been securely charged a "deposit" payment based on the estimated amount of <%= @order.animal.name %>'s delicious meat you'll be receiving. Now you can sit back, smile at your <% link_to "receipt" , @receipt_url %>, and <%= link_to "plan out", @blog_url %> what you'll do with all your <%= @meat_type %>.<br/>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>What's next?</h2>
        <ul>
        	<li>Your meat will be available for pickup on PICKUP DATE from your host, <%= (@host.user.name).capitalize %>, for a window of up to 24 hours (to ensure both freshness and <%= (@host.user.name).capitalize %>'s sanity).</li>
        	<li>Get in touch with <%= link_to (@host.user.name).capitalize, @host_url %>, for pickup details and in case you need to make any changes.</li>
          	<li>When the butcher sends us the real-life weight of your packages, your card will be refunded or charged the difference. If that difference exceeds 15% by weight -- which we take great pains to avoid -- you'll get a discount on your next order. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks again for being a part of our attempt to bring ranchers and meat-lovers a little closer. If there's anything at all we can do to make this experience better, please <%= mail_to "feedback@meatup.in", "let us know" %>.
